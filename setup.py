    # When your source code is in a subdirectory under the project root, e.g.

    # You can just specify package directories manually here if your project is
    # simple. Or you can use find_packages().
    #
    # Alternatively, if you just want to distribute a single Python file, use
    # the `py_modules` argument instead as follows, which will expect a file
    # called `my_module.py` to exist:

    # Specify which Python versions you support. In contrast to the
